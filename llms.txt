This documentation covers account setup, subscriptions, SSO, security, automations, and more.

## Getting Started

- [GitKraken.dev Home](https://help.gitkraken.com/gk-dev/gk-dev-home/): Sign in, connect a Git integration, then open Launchpad to manage PRs and issues. Covers Launchpad, Workspaces, Cloud Patches, and Code Suggest. Cloud Patches and Code Suggest require Pro or higher.

- [GitKraken Trials](https://help.gitkraken.com/gk-dev/gk-dev-trials/): Two trial types—14-day individual trial and 30-day business trial with team features.
- [Connect GitHub, GitLab, Azure Integrations](https://help.gitkraken.com/gk-dev/gk-dev-integrations/): Connect cloud providers (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps) via OAuth, or self-hosted providers via a Personal Access Token. Required for Launchpad, Workspaces, and Cloud Patches.

## Subscription & Billing

- [Manage GitKraken Subscription and Billing](https://help.gitkraken.com/gk-dev/gk-dev-subscription/): Purchase a Pro, Teams, or Enterprise plan, add seats (prorated), cancel, reactivate, update billing method, and download invoices. Only Owners, Admins, and Billing Contacts can manage subscriptions.
- [GitKraken Accounts and Licenses FAQ](https://help.gitkraken.com/gk-dev/gk-dev-faq/): Common questions on trials, license keys, multi-device use, subscription expiry, invoices, and payment options.
- [GitKraken Student Pack](https://help.gitkraken.com/gk-dev/gk-dev-student-pack/): 6-month free Pro trial for students verified through the GitHub Student Developer Pack. Requires GitHub sign-in to sync the license. Trial starts from account creation and cannot be restarted.
- [GitKraken Reseller Guide](https://help.gitkraken.com/gk-dev/gk-dev-reseller/): Resellers sign in with email, purchase via gitkraken.dev/purchase, then add the customer as Billing Contact and transfer ownership. License costs are prorated. Covers existing org purchases and generating upgrade or renewal quotes.

## Organization & Team Management

- [Manage GitKraken Organizations](https://help.gitkraken.com/gk-dev/gk-dev-organization/): Add users by email and assign roles (Owner, Admin, User, Lead, Billing Contact). Supports CSV import/export, team creation, license reallocation, SSO setup, and ownership transfer. Requires Pro or higher.
- [Configure Single Sign-On (SSO)](https://help.gitkraken.com/gk-dev/gk-dev-single-sign-on/): SAML 2.0 SSO available on Teams and Enterprise plans or during the 30-day multi-user trial. Setup requires domain verification via DNS TXT record. Supports JIT provisioning. SSO callback URL: `https://api.gitkraken.com/oauth/sso/callback`. IdP examples include G Suite, Azure AD, Okta, and Ping Identity.

## Insights & Analytics

- [Getting Started with GitKraken Insights](https://help.gitkraken.com/gk-dev/gk-dev-insights/): Access is by request. After approval, connect GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket and import repositories. Past month's data appears within hours; full year within one to two days. Optionally connect an AI provider (Cursor or GitHub Copilot) for AI Impact metrics.
- [Dashboard Management in GitKraken Insights](https://help.gitkraken.com/gk-dev/gk-dev-dashboard-management/): Add metrics from five categories: DORA, Pull Requests, AI Impact, Code Quality, and Velocity. Widgets are resizable and reorderable. Dashboards support trendlines and can be filtered by Workspace, repository, timeframe, and team.

## Automation & Workflows

- [Automations](https://help.gitkraken.com/gk-dev/gk-dev-automations/): Rule-based automations for pull requests and issues, available on Pro or higher (cloud integrations only). Create an automation by selecting a provider and repository, defining conditions (file path, CI/CD outcome, review status, GitKraken AI), and configuring actions (notify, assign reviewers, label, comment, close PR).

## Security

- [Security Information for GitKraken.dev](https://help.gitkraken.com/gk-dev/gk-dev-security/): Data collection, TLS encryption in transit, AES-256 encryption at rest (MongoDB Atlas, Postgres, S3), and SOC2 certification.
- [Security Controls & Cloud Patch Configuration](https://help.gitkraken.com/gk-dev/gk-dev-security-controls/): Enable or disable GitKraken AI features org-wide (Advanced+ plans). Enforce allowed AI providers and custom API keys (Business+ plans). Self-host Cloud Patches on AWS S3 by supplying bucket name, access key, secret key, and region.

## Policies

- [GitKraken Cloud Services Support Terms and Conditions](https://help.gitkraken.com/gk-dev/gk-dev-terms-and-conditions/): Support hours, response time SLAs by plan, support periods, and end-of-life processes.
