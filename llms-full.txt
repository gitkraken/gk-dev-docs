## GitKraken.dev Support Home

URL: https://help.gitkraken.com/gk-dev/gk-dev-home/

GitKraken.dev is a browser-based Git project management app. From tracking issues and pull requests to organizing repositories with your team, GitKraken.dev helps you stay productive directly from your browser.

### Launchpad: Your Daily Git Dashboard

The Launchpad offers a real-time summary of pull requests and issues based on your filters, helping you take action faster without context-switching.

Connect an integration to begin. This feature is only available on Pro or higher plans.

#### Take Quick Actions from Launchpad

Use the actions column to update fields, open branches in GitKraken Desktop or VS Code, merge or close pull requests, and open code suggestions.

#### Refine Results with Filters

Filter the Launchpad by services, statuses (assigned/created/mentioned), or workspaces.

Pin items for priority or snooze them to hide under the SNOOZED section. Return to the SNOOZED section to unsnooze.

### Cloud Patches (PRO)

Cloud Patches let you securely store and share Git patches without a pull request. Create them using GitKraken Desktop, GitLens, or the GitKraken CLI. Store them on GitKraken servers or your own AWS S3 bucket.

This feature is only available on Pro or higher plans.

#### Create and Share Cloud Patches

Initiate patches from GitKraken Desktop, GitLens, or GitKraken CLI. Manage shared Cloud Patches from gitkraken.dev.

#### Apply and Review Patches

Select "Open" to view patch contents. Open patches in GitKraken Desktop or GitLens to apply them.

### Workspaces: Organize Projects by Team

Use Workspaces to group repositories for teams or organizations using GitKraken.dev, GitKraken Desktop, GitLens, or GitKraken CLI.

#### Set Up a New Workspace

Connect a service integration, select "Create Workspace", name it, choose a provider, and set sharing preferences.

#### Use Workspaces Across Tools

Click "Open Launchpad" to focus on that Workspace's repositories. Perform Git actions in your preferred GitKraken tool.

#### Azure Configuration for Workspaces & Insights

To use Workspaces or Insights with Azure DevOps, enable "Third-party application access via OAuth" in Azure's Organization Settings.

### Code Suggest (PRO)

Suggest code edits across your codebase—not just changed lines—using GitKraken.dev, GitLens, or GitKraken Desktop. Suggestions appear in the pull request for review.

This feature is only available on Pro or higher plans.

#### Working with Code Suggestions

Create suggestions in GitKraken Desktop or GitLens. Once submitted, the pull request includes a comment with links to open the suggestion in GitKraken.dev or on your machine. Select "Code Suggestion for #PR" to open in GitKraken.dev and review the changes. Accepting adds a commit to the remote branch.

## Manage Your GitKraken Account

URL: https://help.gitkraken.com/gk-dev/gk-dev-account/

Your GitKraken account provides access to all GitKraken products and services, including GitKraken Desktop, GitLens, CLI, and GitKraken.dev. Use it to manage your identity, license, and preferences in one place.

Note: Your GitKraken account is not compatible with Git Integration for Jira. We recommend using a single GitKraken account for yourself. Avoid creating duplicate accounts or sharing your account with others.

### Sign in or create an account

Go to gitkraken.dev and choose one of the supported login options:

**Git providers:**
- GitHub
- GitLab
- Bitbucket
- Azure DevOps

**Other options:**
- Google
- Microsoft
- Email + password
- Single Sign-On (SSO)

Each login method is tied to your primary email address. If you sign up with email, you'll need to verify it via a confirmation link.

### Personalize your account

Click your avatar in the top right to:
- Change your display name or avatar
- Manage your GitKraken licenses
- Configure email settings
- View your plan and billing information

GitKraken uses Gravatar to manage profile avatars. To change your avatar, select your profile image and follow the link to Gravatar. Updates may take several hours to appear.

### Delete your account

To permanently delete your account:

1. Go to Settings > Account Settings
2. Click "Delete Account"
3. Confirm the deletion in the prompt

Note: If you are part of a GitKraken organization and not an admin, you'll need an admin to remove your account before proceeding.

GitKraken is GDPR-compliant and this action cannot be undone. This action will revoke access to all GitKraken products and services linked to your account.

## Manage GitKraken Subscription and Billing

URL: https://help.gitkraken.com/gk-dev/gk-dev-subscription/

Subscriptions in GitKraken Dev are tied directly to an organization, even if there is only one user.

All members of an organization share the same subscription, and each active member requires a license. Some roles do not consume a license.

### How to purchase

To purchase a subscription for the first time:

1. Visit gitkraken.dev.
2. Log in with your GitKraken account or create one.
3. Select your organization in the left panel, then click "Purchase Subscription". You'll need a role with billing permissions.
4. Set the number of user seats. Choose the subscription tier that best fits your organization (Pro, Teams, or Enterprise).
5. Enter your organization name, first and last name, and your country or region. If you have a promo code, click "Have a promo code?" to enter it. Click "Payment details" to continue.
6. Select a payment method and complete the billing information. Then click "Review your order".
7. Click the "Buy now" button to complete your purchase.
8. If you added more licenses than there are users to assign them to, you'll be redirected to the "Add Users" screen.

### Purchase additional licenses

To purchase additional licenses, you must be an Admin, Owner, or Billing Contact for your organization.

1. Navigate to gitkraken.dev/subscription.
2. Click "Add Seats".
3. Enter the number of licenses to add. A price preview updates automatically. The amount is prorated based on your renewal date.
4. Click "Purchase" to complete the transaction.
5. After purchase, go to gitkraken.dev/users to assign licenses to users.

You can cancel your subscription at any time:

1. Log in to gitkraken.dev
2. Select your organization
3. Go to "Subscription" in the left panel
4. Click "Cancel" and follow the prompts to confirm cancellation

Once canceled, your subscription remains active until the end of the current billing period. After that, all members will lose access to the subscription.

Organizations with a pending cancellation will be labeled as non-renewing. Once fully expired, they will appear as canceled.

Only the Owner, Admins, and Billing Contacts can cancel subscriptions.

### Reactivation

You can reactivate a canceled subscription anytime:

1. Log in to gitkraken.dev
2. Select your organization
3. Go to "Subscription" in the left panel
4. Click "Keep GitKraken"

### Edit billing

To update your billing method:

1. Visit gitkraken.dev

## GitKraken Accounts and Licenses FAQ

URL: https://help.gitkraken.com/gk-dev/gk-dev-faq/

### GitKraken automatically put me in a trial. Is there a way to use the app without the trial?

All new GitKraken accounts automatically begin a 14-day trial of all paid features. If you plan to use the free version, simply let the trial expire—GitKraken will revert to the free plan.

### I just subscribed but I still see FREE in the lower right corner.

Make sure you're logged in with the same email address tied to your paid subscription.

### Can I transfer account ownership?

Yes. If you're the Owner of a Paid subscription, you can transfer ownership to another user from gitkraken.dev/settings/organization.

### How do I transfer ownership if I only have a single license?

First, add the new user as a Billing Contact—this doesn't consume a license. Then transfer ownership.

### Do I need a license to manage users?

Licensed Owner or Admin users can manage others. An unlicensed Billing Contact can view, add, or remove general users. The User role does not have permissions to edit users.

### Can I pay using a Purchase Order?

For GitKraken Pro and Teams, we accept only credit card payments. Purchase orders are accepted for GitKraken On-Premise or On-Premise Serverless.

### When are invoices sent?

Invoice copies are emailed immediately to the purchaser (Owner or Billing Contact) from accounting@gitkraken.com. You can also download them from your Billing History.

### I'm a single-user. What should I enter in the Organization/Company field?

Use a value of your choice—common options include "Personal" or "Self".

### Where is my license key?

Your license is email-based. There is no key. All licenses are managed at gitkraken.dev. Any added users receive an activation email.

### Can I use GitKraken Pro on multiple computers?

Yes! Your license is tied to your email address, not to a specific device.

### What happens when my subscription expires?

Your GitKraken Desktop will revert to the free version. You won't lose any data, but private repos will be inaccessible, and you'll have access to only one profile.

### I need my credit card info removed after purchase.

Please contact our accounting team. Most requests are completed within one business day.

## Manage GitKraken Organizations

URL: https://help.gitkraken.com/gk-dev/gk-dev-organization/

Create an organization in GitKraken.dev to manage your team's access, roles, licenses, and SSO. Centralize your GitKraken subscription to simplify provisioning and oversight across all GitKraken products.

Community users are on a single-user plan and cannot perform any organization management. Pro plans and higher can manage users, roles, teams, and settings.

### Roles

Roles determine what permissions a member has within your organization. There are five roles available:

- **Owner** – Each organization has one owner by default. Full administrative and billing permissions. Consumes a license.
- **Admin** – Full administrative and billing permissions. Consumes a license. Admins cannot change or remove the owner.
- **User** – Can manage teams but no other administrative permissions. Consumes a license.
- **Lead** – Has access to GitKraken Insights and can manage teams but no other administrative permissions. Consumes a license.
- **Billing Contact** – Manages billing-related settings and receives invoices. Does not consume a license.

**Permissions by Role:**

| Permission | Owner | Admin | Lead | User | Billing Contact |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Licensed to use paid GitKraken features | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | |
| Add, edit, and remove users | ✅ | ✅ | | | ✅ |
| Create and manage teams | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Manage billing and purchase licenses | ✅ | ✅ | | | ✅ |
| Transfer ownership of the organization | ✅ | | | | |
| Connect data sources to GitKraken Insights | ✅ | ✅ | | | |
| Access and manage GitKraken Insights | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | | |
| Assign and manage Insights licenses | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | | |

### Add users

To add someone to your organization, go to gitkraken.dev, open the organization dropdown in the top left, select "Users", then click "Add Users".

You can enter multiple email addresses and select the role to assign to all users.

Only members with a role that includes user management permissions can invite others. Adding a user consumes a license from your subscription.

### Inviting users to your organization

As a User, you can invite others to your organization. These invitations must be reviewed and approved by an Owner, Admin, or Billing Contact.

To invite someone:
1. Go to gitkraken.dev
2. Select your organization from the top-left dropdown
3. Navigate to Users > Invite Users
4. Enter the email address(es) of the person you want to invite

Once submitted, Owners, Admins, or Billing Contacts will receive an email notification.

### Reallocate licenses

Owners, Admins, and Billing Contacts can remove existing users to free up licenses, then add new users in their place.

Note: Billing Contacts cannot remove or edit Owner or Admin users.

To reallocate a license:
1. Navigate to "Users"
2. Click "Remove" next to the user you want to remove
3. Invite or add a new user to use the available license

### Import and export users

To import multiple users via CSV, click "Add Users", then choose "Import via CSV". Your file should include these columns: Email, Username, Role, and optionally Teams.

**Example CSV for user import:**
```
Email,Username,Role,Teams
john.doe@example.com,johndoe,user,Frontend Team;Design Team
jane.smith@example.com,janesmith,admin,Backend Team
```

To export your current user list to CSV, click "Export via CSV".

### Teams

Teams help you organize members within your GitKraken organization. Teams can also create Shared Workspaces.

Any member can create a team from the Teams tab in your organization at gitkraken.dev.

**Team Import CSV Format:**
```
Team,Emails
Frontend Team,bob@example.com;john@example.com
Backend Team,jane@example.com
```

### Organization Settings

Access your settings at gitkraken.dev/settings/organization. From here, you can view subscription details and update: organization name, ownership, SSO setup, and organization membership.

### Transfer ownership

If you're the owner of an organization and want to assign ownership to someone else:
1. Make sure the new owner is already added to the organization
2. Go to Settings > Transfer ownership
3. Select the user and confirm their email
4. Click "Transfer Ownership" to finalize the change

Ownership transfers are final unless the new owner reassigns it.

### Leave an organization

To leave an organization:
1. Navigate to Settings > Organization
2. Click "Leave Organization"

You must be part of another organization and cannot be the current owner. Leaving will revoke your GitKraken license and access to shared collaboration features.

### Single sign-on

SSO is available for organizations that require it. Visit the Single Sign-On documentation for setup steps.

---

## Configure Single Sign-On (SSO) for GitKraken

URL: https://help.gitkraken.com/gk-dev/gk-dev-single-sign-on/

Single Sign-On (SSO) is an easy way to manage users across all your services. SSO is supported only for GitKraken cloud users; On-Premise plans are not supported.

Once your organization has set up SSO with an Identity Provider (IdP), the Owner or an Admin can link the GitKraken organization to that IdP.

SSO is available with a GitKraken Advanced or Enterprise subscription. It's also included in the 30-day multi-user trial.

### What is single sign-on (SSO)?

SSO is an authentication method that lets users sign in once and gain access to multiple, independent software systems without needing to re-enter their credentials.

**Key terms:**

**Directory Server:** Stores information about organizational objects such as printers, computers, shared folders, users, or groups.

**Identity Provider (IdP):** Manages identity information and provides authentication services. Examples: Azure Active Directory, Okta, Google Identity Platform.

**Third-party applications:** Services that use an IdP to authenticate users. Examples: GitKraken, Slack, Jira.

### How SSO works in GitKraken

GitKraken supports SAML 2.0 for SSO. Any identity provider that supports SAML 2.0 is compatible.

SSO requires a GitKraken Teams or Enterprise subscription, or a 30-day multi-user trial.

**SSO Enforcement:**
- SSO is enforced at the domain level: Users whose account emails match a verified SSO domain must log in via SSO. Owners and Admins can log in using any method.
- SSO is enforced at the organization level: All users matching a verified domain must be part of the GitKraken organization.
- Users cannot create other organizations or subscriptions.
- Users cannot leave the organization or change their email/password.

**Just-in-time provisioning (JIT):** When JIT is active and a user logs in successfully via SSO, they will automatically join the organization and consume a license. JIT only works if there are available licenses.

### Set up SSO

1. Log in to GitKraken.dev as an Owner or Admin.
2. Navigate to Settings > Single sign-on in the left sidebar.
3. Click "Set up SSO".
4. Complete the connection form:
   - **Connection name**: Name shown to users in GitKraken.
   - **Domain**: Use the base domain (e.g., gitkraken.com).
   - **Identity URL**: Provided by GitKraken, paste this into your IdP.
   - **Credentials**: Choose Metadata URL, raw Metadata, or Certificate.
   - Click "Create Connection" when done.
5. Verify domain ownership by adding a DNS TXT record.
6. (Optional) Add additional domains.
7. Enable SSO and optionally enable JIT.

### Example IdP Setup

**SSO Callback URL for all providers:** `https://api.gitkraken.com/oauth/sso/callback`

**Supported Identity Providers with step-by-step instructions:**
- G Suite / Google Workspace
- Azure Active Directory
- Okta (Note: Logging through Okta Dashboard is not supported)
- Ping Identity

For each provider, use `https://api.gitkraken.com/oauth/sso/callback` as both the ACS URL and Entity ID (or equivalent fields).

#### Available metrics

**DORA metrics:**
- Deploy Frequency
- Change Lead Time
- Mean Time to Repair/Recover (MTTR)
- Defect Rate (% of deploys with severe defect)

**Pull Request metrics:**
- First Response Time ("Pickup time")
- Cycle Time ("first commit" to "merge")
- Lead Time ("first commit" to "deployed")
- Number of Reviews per day/week/month
- Open Time ("opened" to "merged")
- Number of PRs Abandoned
- Number of PRs Merged Without Review
- Number of PR Comments
- PR Size/Effort
- Code Review Hours

**AI Impact metrics:**
- Copy/Paste vs Moved Percent

- Documentation and Test Percent
- Code Change Rate
- Code Change by Operation

**Velocity/Delivery Consistency:**
- Commit Count
- Estimated Coding Hours

### DORA metrics

DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) metrics are a standardized set of four key performance indicators: deployment frequency, lead time for changes, change failure rate, and time to restore service.

**Deploy Frequency:** The total number of deployments over a selected timeframe. Shows how often new code is released to production.

**Change Lead Time:** Time between the first commit linked to an issue and when the associated code is deployed. Expressed in days over a rolling 7-day period.

**Mean Time to Repair/Recover (MTTR):** Business hours between "defect detected" and "final fix deployed". Lower MTTR indicates teams can respond quickly to incidents.

**Defect Rate:** The percentage of deployments that resolve a critical defect. A lower defect rate indicates a more stable deployment process.

### Pull Request metrics

**First Response Time ("Pickup Time"):** Time from when a PR is opened to when the first review or comment is left. Expressed in hours, averaged over a 7-day period.

**Cycle Time:** Time from the first commit to when the PR is merged. Expressed in days, averaged over a 7-day period. PRs are grouped into four categories: Elite (<1 day), Fast (1–7 days), Average (7–29 days), Slower (>30 days).

**Lead Time:** Time from the first commit in a PR to when that code is deployed to production. Bridges development and deployment activities.

**Number of Reviews per Day/Week/Month:** Volume of code reviews completed over a given period.

**Open Time:** Time between when a pull request is opened and when it is merged. Differs from Cycle Time (which starts from first commit); isolates the review and approval phase.

**Number of PRs Abandoned:** Number of pull requests closed without being merged. Can reveal wasted engineering effort or breakdowns in work planning.

**Number of PRs Merged Without Review:** Number of pull requests merged without any (bot or human) review. Identifies PRs integrated without peer review.

**Number of PR Comments:** Total number of comments left on pull requests. Measures engagement during code reviews.

**PR Size/Effort:** Aggregate amount of change (diff delta) across all merged pull requests during a given time period.

**Code Review Hours:** Average time spent in hours during the "review period" of pull requests. Calculated as total review hours / number of committers.

### AI Impact

AI Impact metrics help teams understand how AI coding tools affect code quality and developer efficiency.

**Copy/Paste vs Moved Percent:** Compares how much code is duplicated versus refactored or relocated. Moved lines reflect healthy code reorganization; copy/pasted lines often signal duplicated logic.

**Duplicated Code:** Amount of lines in duplicate blocks detected. Correlates with increased maintenance costs and higher risk of defect propagation.

**Percent of Code Rework (Churned Lines):** Percentage of recently written code that gets modified again quickly. High churn rates can reflect rework caused by unclear goals or limitations in AI-assisted code generation.

**Post PR Work Occurring:** Follow-up work and bug fixes needed after merging. Quantifies rework and fixes needed after a pull request is merged.

**Active Users:** Total count of unique users active in connected AI provider integrations. Tracks AI adoption across teams.

**Suggestions (by total lines):** Number of suggestions offered from connected AI provider integrations.

**Prompt Acceptance Rate:** Percentage of prompt results a developer accepted. A higher rate indicates stronger alignment between AI outputs and developer expectations.

**Tab Acceptance Rate:** Percentage of AI-generated code suggestions developers accept with tab completion.

### Code Quality

**Bug Work Percent:** Ratio of development work spent on fixing bugs vs everything else.

**Documentation and Test Percent:** Percent of work related to tests and documentation.

**Code Change Rate:** Tracks the age of code being modified. Frequent changes to older code may reveal technical debt hotspots.

**Code Change by Operation:** Breaks down engineering work by category (testing, documentation, front-end, back-end).

### Velocity/Delivery Consistency

**Commit Count:** Number of commits pushed to all connected repositories. Tracks volume of code commits over time.

**Estimated Coding Hours:** Estimates the amount of time a team's developers spend coding. Helps leaders assess engineering capacity.

### Layout

- **Resize widgets:** Each widget is available in two sizes—small or large.
- **Rearrange widgets:** Drag and drop from the upper-left corner of a widget.
- **One per dashboard:** Only one copy of each metric can be placed on a dashboard.
- **Widget menu:** Switch between line and bar graph types, resize, export data, or remove widget.

### Trendlines

You can add trendlines to any chart to help visualize patterns over time.

Trendline options:
- **None:** No trendline.
- **Linear:** Straight line showing steady upward or downward trends.
- **Polynomial:** Curved line revealing acceleration, deceleration, or changing directions.

Use GitKraken.dev Automations to create rule-based workflows that trigger actions when pull requests and issues match specific conditions.

This feature is only available on Pro subscription tiers or higher. Automations currently supports cloud integrations. Self-hosted support will be added in a future update.

### Automation examples

- **Safe deployments**: Add a checklist for database migrations.
