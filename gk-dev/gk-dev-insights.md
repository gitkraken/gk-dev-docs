GitKraken Insights transforms raw Git data into actionable intelligence for developers and leaders. By integrating directly into existing workflows, Insights connects code activity, pull requests, issues, and CI/CD results into a single view. 

The platform goes beyond vanity metrics to show how work aligns with business goals, highlights the impact of AI on development, and provides personalized recommendations to help teams improve efficiency and productivity.
