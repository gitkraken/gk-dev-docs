GitKraken Insights turns raw Git data into clear, useful metrics for developers and leaders. It pulls code activity, pull requests, issues, and CI/CD results into a single view that fits directly into existing workflows.

Instead of surface-level stats, Insights shows how work connects to team goals and points out ways to improve flow and productivity.

## Request Access

GitKraken Insights is available by request only. To get started, [request a guided tour](https://www.gitkraken.com/insights#form).  

A member of the GitKraken team will contact you within 1–2 business days to walk you through Insights and explain how to enable access for your organization.
