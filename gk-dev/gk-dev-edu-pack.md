GitKraken Pro is available for free to students and teachers through the GitHub Student Pack. If you don't have the pack yet, first apply through GitHub:

## Enabling Pro for Students

Once GitHub has approved your pack, you must sign into your GitKraken account through GitHub <strong>1 more time</strong> to enable Pro.

To sign in again, launch GitKraken Desktop and navigate to <kbd>File    <i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>     Sign into a Different Account <i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>  Sign in with GitHub</kbd>

Or you may login by navigating to <kbd>the profile dropdown    <i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>     Sign into a Different Account <i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i>  Sign in with GitHub</kbd>

When you sign in with GitHub, GitKraken Desktop will check whether your GitHub account has the GitHub Student Pack. If the app sees the pack, you should see the `Pro` flag in the bottom right of the UI and you will be able to open private repos.

If you don't see `Pro` then this means GitKraken does not see a pack with the email address tied to your GitHub account. This may mean you need to update the primary email address for your GitHub.com account.

## Student Pack FAQ

### How long does it take to approve the GitHub Student Pack?

GitHub controls the approval process for the GitHub Student Pack. If you have questions about the status of your application, please email <a href="mailto:education@github.com">education@github.com</a>.

Once you get approved, all you need to do is sign into your GitKraken account with your GitHub account <strong>1 more time</strong>.

### I got the student pack but I don't see Pro when I open GitKraken. What should I do?

Once GitHub has approved your pack, you must sign into your GitKraken account through GitHub <strong>1 more time</strong> to enable Pro.

If you are still not seeing Pro, sign out of GitHub.com in your default browser. Next, in GitKraken, go to `File > Sign in to a different account > Sign in with GitHub`

<img src='/wp-content/uploads/gkdev-sign-into-a-different-account.png' class='img-bordered img-responsive center'>

Lastly, log into your GitHub.com account using the email address that has the GitHub Pack.

<img src='/wp-content/uploads/gkdev-gh-sign-in.png' class='img-bordered img-responsive center'>

Once authorized, you can go back to GitKraken, and you should see `PRO` in the lower right-hand corner. If you continue not seeing `PRO`, you must confirm with GitHub that you still have the student pack. They can be reached at education@github.com.

### How long will I have Pro as a student or teacher?

You will have Pro while you have an active GitHub Student Pack. Once the pack expires, your GitKraken Pro access will expire too.

### Can I use my GitKraken Pro license on more than one computer?

Yes, your GitKraken subscription is associated with your email address, not a specific computer. So you can use GitKraken Desktop on as many computers as you'd like!
