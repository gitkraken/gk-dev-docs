Connect integrations on GitKraken.dev to use features like Launchpad, Workspaces, and Cloud Patches. Supported integrations include GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, and self-hosted options.

***

## How to Connect an Integration

Go to the <a href="https://gitkraken.dev/settings/integrations?source=help_center&product=gitkraken_dot_dev" target="_blank">Integrations page</a> in GitKraken.dev and follow the instructions based on the type of integration.

### 1. Cloud-Based Integrations (GitHub, GitLab.com, Bitbucket.org, Azure DevOps)

1. Under **Add Integration**, select your service.
2. Log into your account.
3. Approve access when prompted to authorize GitKraken.

### 2. Self-Hosted or Server-Based Integrations

1. Under **Add Integration**, select your self-hosted service (e.g., GitHub Enterprise).
2. Enter the Host Domain.
3. Click **Generate a token on {service}**.
   - This opens a pre-filled Personal Access Token (PAT) creation page.
4. Create the PAT.
5. Paste the token into GitKraken.
6. Click **Connect**.
