Connect integrations on gitkraken.dev to begin working with Launchpad, Workspaces, Cloud Patches, and more. 

***

Integrations can be connected from the <a href="https://gitkraken.dev/settings/integrations?source=help_center&product=gitkraken_dot_dev" target="_blank">Integrations page</a>. To connect an integration, follow these steps:

1. Select the desired integration under **Add Integration**.
2. If connecting a **cloud-based integration**:
    - Log in to your account.
    - Approve access for GitKraken when prompted.
3. If connecting a **self-hosted/server integration**:
    - Enter the Host Domain.
    - Click **Generate a token on {service}** â€” this opens the Personal Access Token (PAT) creation page with the necessary scopes pre-filled.
    - Create the PAT, enter it in GitKraken, then click **Connect**.
