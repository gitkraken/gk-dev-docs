## New Organization Purchases

Follow this reseller guide for purchasing and user license management information.

***

### 1. Create an account or sign in

First, create a GitKraken account using your reseller email address by navigating to [gitkraken.dev](https://gitkraken.dev/).

+ Be sure to create an account using email, do not use the auto-sign-in options (like "sign in with GitHub").
+ Do not enter end-user information on the account creation form. Resellers should register with their own email.
+ After account creation you will need to verify your email before taking any action. This is done by selecting the link sent to your email.

<div class='callout callout--basic'>
   	<p>If you make GitKraken purchases for multiple customers and already have a GitKraken account, choose to sign into an existing account and continue onto Step 2.</p>
</div>

Once you have created your GitKraken account, your account is tied to the primary email address of whichever method you selected. If you use the email method, you will need to verify your email address with a link sent to your email.

<div class='callout callout--basic'>
   	<p>GitKraken Subscriptions only accept card, PayPal, ACH bank payments, and Google Pay. However, invoicing is supported for large purchases of GitKraken Enterprise. Contact our <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/sales-inquiries">Customer Success team</a> to learn more.</p>
</div>

Once the purchase is complete you will be emailed a copy of your receipt.

### 3. Transfer Ownership to the Customer

Finally, you will need to [transfer the ownership](gk-dev/gk-dev-organization/#transfer-ownership) to the customer:
* Navigate to [Users](https://gitkraken.dev/users)
* Add the customer with the role [Billing Contact](/gk-dev/gk-dev-organization/#roles)
	* This role does not consume a license
* Navigate to [Settings > Organization](https://gitkraken.dev/settings/organization) and transfer the ownership to that user

If the customer's email has not been verified, they will receive an email to activate their account and accept the ownership transfer. They have 7 days to accept this and you will remain as owner until they accept it. If the 7 days lapse you can always reinitiate the ownership transfer.
