Your GitKraken account provides access to all GitKraken products and services, including GitKraken Desktop, GitLens, CLI, and GitKraken.dev. Use it to manage your identity, license, and preferences in one place. 

<div class='callout callout--basic'>
  <p>Note that your GitKraken account is not compatible with <a href="/git-integration-for-jira-cloud/git-integration-for-jira-home-gij-cloud/">Git Integration for Jira</a>.</p>
  <p>We recommend using a single GitKraken account for yourself. Avoid creating duplicate accounts or sharing your account with others.</p>
</div>

## Quick Start

A GitKraken account is required to access GitKraken Desktop, GitLens, CLI, and GitKraken.dev using a single set of credentials.

1. Go to [gitkraken.dev](https://gitkraken.dev?source=help_center) and select a login method: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, Google, Microsoft, email, or SSO.
2. If using email, verify your address via the confirmation link sent to your inbox.
3. After signing in, click your avatar in the top right to access account settings: display name, avatar, licenses, email preferences, and billing.
4. To update your avatar, navigate to account settings and follow the link to Gravatar. GitKraken uses Gravatar for profile images.
5. To delete your account, go to **Settings > Account Settings > Delete Account**. This action is GDPR-compliant and cannot be undone.

A single GitKraken account applies across all GitKraken products. Licenses are email-based and tied to one account per person. Avoid creating duplicate accounts.
