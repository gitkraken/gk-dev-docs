Your GitKraken account is your key to unlock the most personal experience across GitKraken products.

<div class='callout callout--basic'>
    <p>Note that your GitKraken account is not compatible with <a href="/git-integration-for-jira-cloud/git-integration-for-jira-home-gij-cloud/">Git Integration for Jira</a>.</p>
    <p>We recommend using a single GitKraken account for yourself. Avoid creating duplicate accounts or sharing your account with others.</p>

## Login

You can create a GitKraken account at [gitkraken.dev](https://gitkraken.dev/register?source=help_center&product=gitkraken_dot_dev) or from GitKraken Desktop. On the login screen, click “Create an account,” then choose from one of the following methods:

- GitHub
- GitLab
- Bitbucket
- Azure DevOps
- Google
- Email
- [Single Sign-On (SSO)](/gk-dev/gk-dev-single-sign-on/)

Each login method is tied to your primary email address. If you sign up with email, you’ll need to verify it via a confirmation link.

## Delete

You can delete your account at [gitkraken.dev/account](https://gitkraken.dev/account?source=help_center&product=gitkraken_dot_dev) by selecting "<span style='color: red;'>Delete my Account</span>."

> **Note:** If you are part of a GitKraken organization and not an admin, you'll need an admin to remove your account before proceeding.

Once deleted, your account and all associated data—including subscriptions, cloud workspaces, Insights, and organizations—are permanently removed. GitKraken is GDPR-compliant and this action cannot be undone.
