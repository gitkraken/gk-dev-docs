Your GitKraken account provides access to all GitKraken products and services, including GitKraken Desktop, GitLens, CLI, and GitKraken.dev. Use it to manage your identity, license, and preferences in one place. 

<div class='callout callout--basic'>
  <p>Note that your GitKraken account is not compatible with <a href="/git-integration-for-jira-cloud/git-integration-for-jira-home-gij-cloud/">Git Integration for Jira</a>.</p>
  <p>We recommend using a single GitKraken account for yourself. Avoid creating duplicate accounts or sharing your account with others.</p>
