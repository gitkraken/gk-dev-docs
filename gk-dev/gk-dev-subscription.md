Subscriptions in GitKraken Dev are tied directly to an [organization](/gk-dev/gk-dev-organization/), even if there is only one user.

All members of an organization share the same subscription, and each active member requires a license. Some [roles](/gk-dev/gk-dev-organization/#roles) do not consume a license.

***

## How to purchase

To purchase a subscription for the first time:

1. Visit [gitkraken.dev](https://gitkraken.dev?source=help_center&product=gitkraken_dot_dev).
2. Log in with your [GitKraken account](/gk-dev/gk-dev-account/) or create one.
3. Select your organization in the left panel, then click **Purchase Subscription**. You’ll need a [role](/gk-dev/gk-dev-organization/#roles) with billing permissions.
4. Set the number of user seats. Choose the subscription tier that best fits your organization (Pro, Teams, or Enterprise). Each tier includes a link to learn more.
5. Enter your organization name, first and last name, and your country or region. If you have a promo code, click **Have a promo code?** to enter it. Click **Payment details** to continue.
6. Select a payment method and complete the billing information. Then click **Review your order**.
7. Click the **Buy now** button to complete your purchase.
8. If you added more licenses than there are users to assign them to, you’ll be redirected to the **Add Users** screen.

## Purchase additional licenses

To purchase additional licenses, you must be an **Admin**, **Owner**, or **Billing Contact** for your organization.

Follow these steps to add licenses to your GitKraken subscription:

1. **Go to your subscription page**  
   Navigate to [gitkraken.dev/subscription](https://gitkraken.dev/subscription?source=help_center&product=gitkraken_dot_dev).

2. **Click "Add Seats"**  
   Select the **Add Seats** button.

3. **Enter the number of licenses**  
   A modal appears. Enter how many licenses you want to add. A price preview updates automatically. The amount is **prorated** based on your renewal date.  
   *(Prorated means you pay only for the remaining time until your next renewal.)*

4. **Complete your purchase**  
   When ready, click **Purchase** to complete the transaction.

5. **Allocate new licenses**  
   After purchase, go to [gitkraken.dev/users](https://gitkraken.dev/users?source=help_center&product=gitkraken_dot_dev) to assign licenses to users.

## Cancel

You can cancel your subscription at any time. To do so:

1. Log in to [gitkraken.dev](https://gitkraken.dev/?source=help_center&product=gitkraken_dot_dev)
2. Select your organization
3. Go to **Subscription** in the left panel
4. Click **Cancel** and follow the prompts to confirm cancellation

Once canceled, your subscription remains active until the end of the current billing period. After that, all members will lose access to the subscription.

Organizations with a pending cancellation will be labeled as **non-renewing**. Once fully expired, they will appear as **canceled**.

<div class='callout callout--info'>
    <p>Only the Owner, Admins, and Billing Contacts can cancel subscriptions.</p>
</div>

2. Select your organization
3. Go to **Subscription** in the left panel
4. Click **Keep GitKraken**

If the subscription is labeled **non-renewing** and still active, reactivation won’t trigger a charge until your next renewal or if you upgrade your plan.
