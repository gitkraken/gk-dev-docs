Subscriptions are tied directly to an [organization](/gk-dev/gk-dev-organization/), even if the subscription is for one user. The subscription is identical for everyone in the organization and one license is required for every member (unless their [role](/gk-dev/gk-dev-organization/#roles) does not use a license).

## How to purchase

To purchase a subscription for the first time follow these steps:
1. Visit [gitkraken.dev](https://gitkraken.dev).
2. Login with your [GitKraken account](/gk-dev/gk-dev-account/) or create an account.
3. Select your organization in the left panel and select "Purchase Subscription" (remember you need to have a [role](/gk-dev/gk-dev-organization/#roles) with permission to purchase).
4. Set the desired number of user seats. Then, select the tier that is best for your organization (Pro, Teams, or Enterprise). There are links at the bottom of each while can further elaborate on the differences.
5. Fill out the Organization name, First name, Last name, and country or region. If you have a promo code, select "Have a promo code?" and provide it. Proceed by selecting "Payment details".
6. Select the desired payment method and proceed with filling out the required billing information if needed. Then select "Review your order".
7. Select the "<span style='color: green;'>Buy now</span>" button to complete your transaction.
8. If you added more licenses than there are members in the organization to claim, you will be taken to the "Add Users" screen.

## Cancel

You can cancel your subscription at any time. To do so, login to [gitkraken.dev](https://gitkraken.dev/), select the organization, select "Subscription" on the left side, and select "<span style='color: red;'>Cancel</span>." Follow the flow to complete cancellation. Once canceled, you will keep your subscription for the remainder of its billing period. Once the period is up, everyone in the organization will lose access to the subscription.

When your subscription is set to cancel but you can still use it, your organization will be labeled as "<span style='color: red;'>non-renewing</span>." When your subscription is completely canceled and the billing period has passed, it will be labeled as "<span style='color: red;'>canceled</span>."

<div class='callout callout--basic'>
   	<p>Only the owner, admins, and billing contacts have permission to cancel.</p>

You can always reactivate a canceled subscription. You can reactivate by logging into [gitkraken.dev](https://gitkraken.dev/), select the organization, select "Subscription" on the left side, and select "<span style='color: green;'>Keep GitKraken</span>." 

If your subscription is set to cancel but still active, denoted as <span style='color: red;'>non-renewing</span>, reactivation will not charge you until your next renewal or if you decide to upgrade from the plan you already have.
