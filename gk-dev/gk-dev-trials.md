## 14-Day Trials

Both GitKraken Desktop and GitLens offer a 14-day trial of Pro. You can start a trial by logging into the respective app with your GitKraken account for the first time. Each trial is independent, and so starting a trial in one product does not activate it for the other.

### Business Plan Trials

Business plan trials are available for teams or organizations that want to evaluate the [GitKraken DevEx platform](https://www.gitkraken.com/devex). The Business plan trial lasts 30 days and is shared by all members of the organization.

To start a Business plan trial:

1. Visit [gitkraken.dev](https://gitkraken.dev/?source=help_center&product=gitkraken_dot_dev)
2. Log in using your GitKraken account
3. Navigate to [Users](https://gitkraken.dev/users?source=help_center&product=gitkraken_dot_dev)
4. Add one or more users
5. Once users are added, the organization-wide trial begins
