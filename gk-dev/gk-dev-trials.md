## Trials 

Both GitKraken Desktop and GitLens offer 14-day trials of Pro. You can initiate these trials by logging into the corresponding app with a GitKraken account for the first time. Each trial is separate, so starting a 14-day trial with your GitKraken account in one app does not start it for the other.

### Business Plan Trials
