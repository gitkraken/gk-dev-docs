## Trial options

GitKraken offers two types of trials:

- **14-day trial:** Try GitKraken Pro features on your own.
- **Business trial (30 days):** Invite your team and try the full GitKraken platform.

To compare features, visit the [GitKraken pricing page](https://www.gitkraken.com/pricing?source=help_center&product=gitkraken_dot_dev).

***

## Start a 14-day trial

Both GitKraken Desktop and GitLens offer a [14-day trial](https://www.gitkraken.com/pricing?source=help_center&product=gitkraken_dot_dev). You can start a trial by logging into the respective app with your GitKraken account for the first time. 

Each trial is independent, and so starting a trial in one product does not activate it for the other.

***

## Start a Business trial

1. Visit [gitkraken.dev](https://gitkraken.dev/?source=help_center&product=gitkraken_dot_dev)
2. Log in using your GitKraken account
3. Navigate to [Users](https://gitkraken.dev/users?source=help_center&product=gitkraken_dot_dev)
4. Add one or more users
5. Once users are added, the organization-wide trial begins

Business trials include:

- 30 days of full access
- Support for multiple users and license management
- SSO setup and workspace configuration
