GitKraken provides centralized security settings to help your organization control data-sharing features, enforce compliance, and manage where Git patches are stored.

***

## GitKraken AI Features

GitKraken AI features can suggest code or perform smart actions to improve your workflow. These features may require sending code snippets to GitKraken AI hosted in the cloud.

If these features donâ€™t align with your organization's security policies, you can disable them for all members in your organization.

- Go to <strong>Settings > Security Controls > AI Features</strong>
    - Requires [owner, admin, or billing contact](/gk-dev/gk-dev-organization/#roles)
    - Available on [Teams or Enterprise plans](https://www.gitkraken.com/pricing)

***

## Cloud Patches

Allow developers in your organization to create Cloud Patches that can be shared with others. Cloud Patches are encrypted Git patch files that GitKraken can store in GitKraken-managed or customer-managed storage.

If your company policies require internal storage, you can set up self-hosted Cloud Patches using your own AWS S3 bucket.

If this setup is not feasible, please contact our <a href="https://www.gitkraken.com/contact" target="_blank">customer success team</a>.

### Self-Host Cloud Patches with AWS S3

Configure your GitKraken organization to store Cloud Patches on your own infrastructure.

#### Requirements

- An AWS account with S3 access
- Admin permissions to apply bucket policies
- GitKraken Pro or Enterprise plan

#### Setup Steps

1. **Create an S3 bucket** and give it a meaningful name (e.g., `gitkraken-cloud-patches`).
2. **Apply the GitKraken-supplied bucket policy** using the UI template.
3. **Enter your AWS credentials** into GitKraken:
   - Bucket name
   - Access key ID
   - Secret access key
   - AWS region
4. **Test the connection** and save your configuration.

  <p>
    GitKraken encrypts all Cloud Patches, even when self-hosted. Only users with access to the patch link and repository permissions can view contents.
