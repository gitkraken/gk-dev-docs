### GitKraken automatically put me in a trial. Is there a way to use the app without the trial?

All new GitKraken accounts will automatically get a GitKraken trial of all paid client features. 

If you plan to use the free version, the trial will automatically end after 7 days and the app will change to the free version.

If you have questions about your trial, please [contact our sales team](https://www.gitkraken.com/sales-inquiries).

### I just subscribed but I still fee FREE in the lower right corner.

Be sure you are logged in with the same email address registered with your paid GitKraken subscription. You can check by navigating to <em class='context-menu'><i class="fa fa-bars"> </i>  <i class='fa fa-caret-right'></i> Sign into a different account</em>, and then verify that your email is correct.

***

### Can I transfer account ownership?

Yes. If you are the `Owner` of a <strong>Paid</strong> subscription, then you may [transfer ownership](/gk-dev/gk-dev-organization/#transfer-ownership) to a different user on your account from [gitkraken.dev/settings/organization](https://gitkraken.dev/settings/organization).

### How do I transfer the ownership if I only have a single license?

First, add the user with the role [Billing Contact](/gk-dev/gk-dev-organization/#roles) - this does not consume a license - and then transfer the ownership to them.

***

### Do I need a license to manage users?

A licensed <kbd>Owner</kbd> or <kbd>Admin</kbd> may manage other <kbd>Admin</kbd> or general users. However, the unlicensed <kbd>Billing Contact</kbd> role may view the users list and add or remove general users.

The <kbd>User</kbd> role does not have permission to allocate, edit or remove users. 

***

### Can I pay using a Purchase Order.

We only accept credit card payments for GitKraken Pro and Teams. We do however accept purchase orders for [GitKraken On-Premise or On-Premise Serverless](https://gitkraken.com/pricing). Please [contact our sales team](https://www.gitkraken.com/sales-inquiries) for more information.

***

### When are invoices sent when I purchase a paid license?

Invoice copies are emailed to the purchaser (Owner or Billing Contact) from `accounting@gitkraken.com` immediately upon purchase. You can also obtain a copy by going to [Billing History](https://gitkraken.dev/subscription/history).

***

### I'm just a single-user using GitKraken Pro. What do I put for the Organization/Company field?

Enter a value of your choice. Most use "Personal" or "Self". 

***

### I just purchased a license. Where is my key? Shouldn't I get emailed a license?

You license is tied to your email. While GitKraken Desktop is a downloadable application, there is no key for your account. All GitKraken licenses are managed from [gitkraken.dev](https://gitkraken.dev/). Additionally, any users you add to your account will be emailed a link to activate their account automatically.

***

### Can I use my paid GitKraken subscription on more than one computer?

Yes, your paid GitKraken subscription is associated with your email address, not a specific computer. So you can use GitKraken Pro on as many computers as you'd like!

***

### What happens to my GitKraken Desktop when my subscription expires?

Your GitKraken Desktop will revert to the free version when the paid subscription expires. You will not lose any data, but the client will not open any private repos and you will only retain access to 1 [profile](/gitkraken-desktop/profiles/).

If using the GitKraken Stand-Alone Client, the client will lock upon license expiration until an updated license file is applied. 

***

### I will pay using a credit card, but I need the credit card details removed after purchase.

Please [contact our accounting team](https://www.gitkraken.com/billing-issues) with any request to manually remove billing details from an account. We typically fulfill these requests within 1 business day.
